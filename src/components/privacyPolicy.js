            When you use our website, we collect and store your personal
            information from you. Our primary goal in doing so is to provide a
            safe, efficient, smooth and customized experience. This allows us to
            provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and
            to customize our Site to make your experience safer and easier.
            Importantly, we only collect personal information about you that we
            consider necessary for achieving this purpose.
            <br />
            <br />
            In general, you can browse the website without telling us who you
            are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you
            give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us.
            Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which
            fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide
            information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature
            on the website. You may provide us with a user ID.
            <br />
            <br />
            We may automatically track certain information about you based upon
            your behavior on our site. We use this information to do internal
            research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to
            better understand, protect and serve our users. This information is
            compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. This information may
            include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our
            site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our
            site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP
            address.
            <br />
            <br />
            We use data collection devices such as “cookies” on certain pages of
            the website to help analyze our web page flow, measure promotional
            effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. “Cookies” are small
            files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our
            services. We offer certain features that are only available through
            the use of a “cookie”. We also use cookies to allow you to enter
            your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also
            help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most
            cookies are “session cookies,” meaning that they are automatically
            deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always
            free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in
            that case you may not be able to use certain features on the website
            and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently
            during a session. Additionally, you may encounter “cookies” or other
            similar devices on certain pages of the website that are placed by
            third parties. We do not control the use of cookies by third
            parties.

            us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other
            users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities
            or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file
